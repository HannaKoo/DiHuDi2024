### Embracing the "natural" in natural language processing: focus on variation

Many groundbreaking efforts in natural language processing have focused on very clean linguistic setups: large languages written in a standard variety without much noise. While this line of work has led to great strides in language technology, most of everyday language usage is anything but clean. In my talk, I will discuss works past and present which aim to use natural language processing methods to study language variation and change. For instance, I will discuss what do machine translation models learn about dialects, how does word segmentation affect dialectal differentiation, and how does dialect usage evolve in the Suomi24 forum. I will also briefly comment on my current work, which aims to use acoustic modeling and automatic speech recognition tools for the study of language variation and change.

### Introduction to Digital Rhetoric: from Aristotle to Algorithms

In this talk, I will present the concept of digital rhetoric which refers both to the skill of persuasion online and to the field of study examining persuasion in digital contexts. I will explain some of the characteristics of public online rhetoric and illustrate them with examples taken from different fora. The presentation is based on a book I am working on with Maria Eronen-Valli (University of Vaasa).

### AADA - Archaeological Artefact Database of Finland

The AADA - Archaeological Artefact Database of Finland is an online repository that provides access to information on archaeological artifacts discovered in Finland. It serves as a centralized digital platform for researchers, archaeologists, and the general public to explore the archaeological heritage of the country. The database includes details about the find location, context, and characteristics of artifacts, as well as photographs and descriptions of the finds. AADA also facilitates spatial research by providing information about the find locations of artefacts. This enables researchers to analyze the distribution of archaeological finds in relation to their environment, and allows them to examine how specific artifact types or cultural features are distributed across different regions, thus aiding in studies of trade routes, settlement patterns, and historical interactions, etc.

### Extraction of information from multilingual scientific literature with large language models

Large language models (LLMs) have shown great capacity to interpret human language and are no longer just an entertaining toy.
Rather, they can be viewed as a useful tool to help with mundane tasks on large datasets. Moreover, modern LLMs are fluently multilingual, allowing aggregation of information from texts across different languages. In this short demonstration, we will see the application of LLMs to question-answering based information extraction from Russian-language archeological literature. In the followup discussion, we can consider its potential and ways to benchmark the relative merit of such tools in research work.

## 15:00-15:30 Coffee break

## 15:30-16:30 Keynote session
#### Chair: Hanna-Mari Kupari

## Kalle Korhonen (University of Helsinki and Kone Foundation)
### An instance of sustained plurilingualism (or not?): Sicily, 6th c. BCE – 14th c. CE

The two millennia discussed here witnessed the extinction of several languages, but also a period of sustained bilingualism between Ancient Greek (Medieval Greek) and Latin (Romance). In the paper I will present some of the more difficult issues in the study of ancient Sicilian plurilingualism.

The event is free for participants, registration is mandatory for all types of participation. Register by October 31st.
